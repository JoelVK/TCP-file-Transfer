Current work to do:
 1. client needs to not exit on entering invalid port number mayber server too?
 2. should server report every packet sent with size? fills up screen with large files
 3. should client still print out data being received? doent make sense for data other than plain text
 4. should the server have a means of quitting by a message like the client does or do we want to leave it as ^C quit only
